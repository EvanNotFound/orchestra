# Orchestra

Cognitive Architectures for Multi-Agent Teams | [Documentation](https://docs.orchestra.org)

## Overview

Orchestra is an agentic framework for building LLM-based pipelines and multi-agent teams. It implements a unique approach to agent orchestration that goes beyond simple routing, enabling complex workflows.

## Key Features

- **Modularity**: Modular architecture for easy building, extension, and integration
- **Agent Orchestration**: Agents can act as both executors and conductors, enabling dynamic task decomposition and coordination among agents
- **Phased Task Execution**: Reduces cognitive load on LLMs through structured thinking patterns
- **Tool Integration**: Simple docstring-based tool definitions without complex JSON schemas
- **Streaming Support**: Real-time output streaming with both sync and async support
- **Built-in Fallbacks**: Graceful handling of LLM failures with configurable fallback chains
